It's time to get holly and jolly


Hello!!

I go by $\text{\color{#ff8da1}Omo}$ or $\text{\color{#ff8da1}Atlas.}$

Pt addict! Usually online, more afk than not. If I randomly disappear for an extended period of time, I might've lost connection. Sorry if I don't respond to a whisper, I'm often busy irl. Please be patient if my responses are slow, I get nervous easily. I am sometimes unorganized when writing (probably shows here) ^^'

I like to give pearls/clovers to really awesome people. :3

I communicate ingame a lot through nods/headshakes and boops.
CUDZ ENTHUSIAST!!

Biggest fan of $\text{\color{#9ca0ff}perwinkle}$


FNF, Omori, AC, AJ, StH, Eb/M2, M3, Bluey, SU, DW and Pkmn enjoyer!! 

(I like other things too, but I didn't want the list to get too long.)

Gen 5 enthusiast (Oshawott my beloved <3)

C+H, W2i / Iwcare. (May not respond if I'm not around at the time. I'm often afk for several hours at a time, meaning it could take a while for me to see a whisper.) 

My discord is omofox. However please whisper/talk to me ingame before adding me on there. I do not typically text first nor am I the best at keeping a conversation up. 

Updating this later when I have the time!

Thank you for reading!! :3
